# What is AtomJS?

AtomJS is a **class-based JavaScript framework** built with TypeScript.  
It combines the familiar **component model of React** with the **simplicity of Vue**, while staying lightweight and explicit.

At its core, AtomJS provides:

-   **Virtual DOM Engine** — Efficient object representation of UI elements
-   **JSX Runtime** — Full support for `jsx`, `jsxs`, and `jsxDEV`
-   **Element Creation** — Strongly-typed `createElement` for building nodes
-   **DOM Rendering** — Utilities to mount and update components in the browser
-   **Event Handling** — Built-in support for events like `onClick` and `onInput`
-   **Fragments** — Render multiple children without unnecessary wrappers
-   **Tooling** — TypeScript integration, source maps, and testing support (Jest, WebDriverIO)

## Why AtomJS?

Most modern UI frameworks fall into two camps:

-   **React-style libraries** — Flexible but increasingly complex and hook-heavy
-   **Vue-style frameworks** — Simple but rely on hidden magic and reactivity layers

AtomJS offers an alternative path: **clarity, explicitness, and class-driven design**, without sacrificing developer experience.

## Current Status

AtomJS is in **active development**.  
The current phase focuses on the **core runtime**: rendering, JSX, and component structure.

Future iterations will expand into state management, routing, and developer tooling.
